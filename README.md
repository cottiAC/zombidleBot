## Limitation
* works only with Steam release right now
* You need to change the game resolution to 1136x640
* if you use another browser window, the bot will not click to avoid take away focus
* in order to find scrolls, the browser windows must be visible
* Bot will switch from world 2 to 1, 1 to 3, 3 to 4 and so on. So you need to start with world 2 
* you need [Autohotkey v1.1.*](https://autohotkey.com/) to run the script


## Graphite Instruction (optional)
* [Install Graphite](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id2)
* configure your Graphite host and port in privatesettings.ini (privatesettings.ini will be created after first Bot start)
* change **graphiteenable** to true in your privatesettings.ini
* Download netcat (nc.exe) from [netcat Homepage](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/) or use the [cygwin netcat](https://cygwin.com/) and include it to your PATH variable
* structure of whisper paths are `zombidle.loot.%graph%`. %graph% can be:
  * x4_Skull
  * 5_Level
  * craftingTime
  * 5_Diamonds
  * 10_Diamonds
  * x2_DMG
  * Chest
  * NA

* you can use [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) to visualize it

## Known issues
* When game is paused, ability timer can go negative until next activation
* With too much lag you sometimes get stuck on world map during world switch
* "COME ON! CHOP CHOP!" message not handled

## Ideas for later releases
* Reset World
